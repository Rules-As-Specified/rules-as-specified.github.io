Rules as Specified
---

Considering the two common approaches:

- _Rules as Intended_ (**RAI**): the intention itself may not always be clear.
- _Rules as Written_ (**RAW**):the wording may be ambiguous.

We propose a third approach, _Rules as Specified_ (**RAS**), where each rule’s specification can be verified. In this model, the rule’s intention must be sound, while its written form illustrates but does not determine the rule.
